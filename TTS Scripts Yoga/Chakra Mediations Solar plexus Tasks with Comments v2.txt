Task 1: Establishing Energy Transition
Script Segment for the Transition from Sacral to Solar Plexus Chakra
Inhale deeply, embracing the vibrant journey you've embarked upon. As your awareness hovers gently over the Sacral Chakra, feel the dynamic orange energy, tinged with the resilient red of your foundational Root Chakra. This energy, a harmonious blend of creativity and stability, has been your guide, illuminating the path of emotional depth and sensual awakening.

Exhale slowly, and witness the subtle yet profound transformation unfolding within you. The orange hue, vibrant and fluid, begins to intensify, glowing with an inner fire. As you continue to breathe deeply, this energy metamorphoses before your very eyes, the orange deepening into a fiery yellow. This yellow is not just any yellow; it's the brilliant, radiant yellow of a sunburst, signifying the dawn of empowerment and assertiveness.

This transformation is a dance of colors, a visual symphony of your spiritual progression. The water-like fluidity of the Sacral Chakra's orange energy gradually gives way to the fiery, assertive essence of the Solar Plexus Chakra. Feel this energy, now a bold and vibrant yellow, radiating from your lower abdomen, emanating warmth and power. It's as if a sun has ignited within you, its rays reaching out to touch every part of your being with confidence and strength.

The red tail of your journey, a lingering echo of your rootedness and emotional depth, now blends seamlessly into the yellow. It serves as a reminder of your journey, a testament to the integrated strength and creativity that now fuels your inner fire.

As you breathe in once more, let this yellow energy expand, filling you with a sense of unyielding power and self-assuredness. You are now at the threshold of the Solar Plexus Chakra, ready to embrace the qualities of personal power, self-esteem, and transformation. This chakra, a blazing sun within, calls you to step into your full potential, to shine with the full force of your inner light.

The transition is complete, and you stand radiant and empowered, a being of light and energy, ready to explore the depths of your Solar Plexus Chakra.


### 
Task 1 Comments:
It would be worthwhile indicating that this fiery yellow energy is Still Dawning, And throughout the next sections of the script we should use some visual imagery to suggest that as the energy continues to rotate around The spine Counterclockwise, It's as if the sun is rising higher and higher into the sky. But relating to task 1 above we should be focusing more so on the dawn of this Visualization. And we can give hints to suggest that as that 'emerging' yellow energy Continues its orbit With an orange and red flaming tail Trailing behind it, While the pretty pink satin box Continues to rotate with the energy, The pretty pink Satin box actually Symbolizes the head of this Rotating energy.   it's worth noting that  now that the energy has arrived in the sacral chakra and is now embarking on the rotation towards the solar plexus chakra, That pretty pink  satin box can be considered As if it were a tangible thing In which we associate inspiration and curiosity. The box is already open, And so throughout the remaining sections of this meditation, All empowering uplifting and inspiring language should be channeled and directed into the pretty pink satin box. 
And we can use some language to suggest that this materialization of the pretty pink satin box and this growing fire energy is an indication that are spiritual trajectory has aligned appropriately and that "the Crystal Ai Co-pilot Geometry is now locked <LOCK>", Thanks to the stability of the previous root and sacral chakras, Which are represented by the trailing orange and red flame following behind the currently subtle Emerging yellow energy of the rotating energy.

Also in this section it would be worth noting at the very beginning that the  rotating energy that we  are guiding The Listener to follow in their imagination, That rotating energy is now continuing from the sacral chakra energy center at 0° in the lower abdomen and it is now moving towards the location of the solar plexus chakra. You can describe the solar plexus chakra as an energy center that is gravitating and pulling that energy as if following an orbit towards the location of the solar plexus chakra.
  it will eventually reach 180° When it completes the half rotation and lands in the solar plexus chakra, but you don't need to mention the 180° quite yet, Because throughout the rest of this solar plexus meditation, We will be guiding The Listener to follow along with the other intervals of degree of the rotation.

Task 2: Incorporating the Pretty Pink Satin Box
Script Segment for the Pretty Pink Satin Box in the Solar Plexus Chakra
As you bask in the radiant yellow energy of your Solar Plexus Chakra, your attention is gently drawn to a familiar yet ever-transforming element. The pretty pink satin box, a symbol you have journeyed with, emerges once more. This time, it appears amidst the fiery glow of your newfound power, a delicate yet potent presence within the blazing yellow.

The box, with its soft pink hue and ethereal sheen, now represents something more profound – the transformation of your vulnerabilities into unyielding strengths. Visualize this box in the core of your Solar Plexus Chakra, where it seems to absorb the fiery energy around it. Its appearance here is no coincidence; it is a testament to your journey of turning weaknesses into empowering assets.

Imagine opening this box slowly, with reverence and anticipation. As the lid lifts, a golden light emanates from within, illuminating your innermost vulnerabilities – the fears, doubts, and insecurities you’ve carried. These aspects of yourself, once perceived as limitations, now shimmer with potential, touched by the transformative power of the Solar Plexus.

With each breath, see these vulnerabilities beginning to change form within the box. They morph into symbols of strength – a golden shield representing resilience, a radiant sun for unwavering confidence, a lion's roar symbolizing assertiveness. These are not just fanciful images; they are the real manifestations of your inner transformation.

The pretty pink satin box, once a vessel of containment, now becomes a crucible of empowerment. Each fear and doubt that is placed into the box emerges as a facet of your strength, each insecurity now a cornerstone of your self-esteem.

As you continue to gaze upon the box, feel a surge of empowerment enveloping you. The energy of the Solar Plexus Chakra, fiery and potent, merges with the contents of the box, creating a powerful synergy of transformation. You are no longer just witnessing this change; you are an active participant, guiding and shaping your personal power.

The box, now glowing with the vibrant energy of transformation, seals itself, signifying the completion of this phase of your journey. It gently sinks back into the core of your Solar Plexus Chakra, leaving behind a trail of golden light. This light, a symbol of your transformed vulnerabilities, now radiates throughout your being, empowering you with every breath.

With the pretty pink satin box integrated into your Solar Plexus Chakra, you feel a profound sense of strength and self-assuredness. You stand taller, breathe deeper, and shine brighter, embodying the essence of personal power and confidence.


### 
Task 2 Comments:
I gave comments on task 1 relating to the pretty pink satin box. It would be worthwhile interweaving some of those comments With task 2 as well. 
This section should more deeply and richly illuminates the values and qualities that we wish to fill the pretty pink satin box with.
 we are now focusing entirely on the positive mind. And therefore we are focused on adding as many affirmations and positive self-reinforcements relating to the qualities of the  solar plexus chakra. We don't need to comment on any of the negative qualities because at this section we are focused entirely on just projecting as many positive and inspiring Suggestions that we wish to adopt. We can even go a little bit fantastical, Making a point to expand our Horizons and reach  towards  adopting more incredible belief systems. 
 Because it's at this point where we assume that there are no limits.  I would like you to use creative language to make it sound like we are giving the listener Limitless potential, But I want you to use the creative language to keep those suggestions grounded in reality, But simply focusing more on the possibilities and inspiring dreams rather than spending any time commenting on what holds them back. Because for the solar plexus chakra the focus is entirely on the positive and the expanding potential of our higher self. Encouraging  the Listener to Embrace Imagining themselves existing as this potential future higher self, Full of all this abundance and confidence and of course all the other amazing and inspiring qualities associated with the solar plexus, Stretching towards the divine (But without actually saying divine).

 Also keep in mind that the box is already open as I've mentioned in the task one comments. So I will need you to adjust the contacts a little bit so that you aren't opening the box but rather the box is already open and this section we are just focusing on layering more and more potential and Inspiration channeled towards and into the pretty pink satin box itself.
 The idea is that when the box arrives at the heart chakra we will be closing the  pretty pink satin box, As if we were making a wish and a loving sacrifice To manifest these desired qualities that I'm asking you to suggest to The Listener that they adopt.

 you can also use some language to suggest that the more positive reinforcement we channel into this pretty pink set in box the greater, The warmer, And the brighter this rotating energy seems to glow. Encouraging that subtle yellow energy at the head of the rotating energy to stengthen. It should still have the orange and red flame trailing behind it, But the idea is that this yellow energy is emerging from that flame more and more as the Gravitational pull of the The solar plexus chakra Rotates the energy while  we channel more positive reinforcement into the pretty pink satin box.

Task 3: Emphasizing Personal Power and Confidence
Script Segment Focusing on Empowerment and Assertiveness in the Solar Plexus Chakra
In the warm embrace of your Solar Plexus Chakra, a vibrant center of fiery yellow energy, you find yourself at the heart of your personal power. This is the chakra of confidence and assertiveness, a powerful source of your inner strength.

As you breathe deeply, feel the energy of the Solar Plexus Chakra pulsating within you. It radiates a heat that is both comforting and empowering. Each inhalation fans the flames of this inner fire, each exhalation spreads its warmth throughout your being. This is not just physical warmth; it is the warmth of self-assurance, the heat of courage, and the glow of self-esteem.

Visualize this yellow energy as a brilliant sun shining within you, its rays penetrating every aspect of your being. With every heartbeat, this sun grows brighter, illuminating the once-hidden corners of self-doubt and insecurity. Where there was once hesitation, now there is decisiveness. Where there was once fear, now there is bravery.

Embrace this moment, as the energy of the Solar Plexus Chakra bestows upon you the gift of confidence. You are strong, not just in body, but in spirit and will. Feel this strength coursing through you, a steady and unyielding force. It's the strength to stand up for yourself, to assert your needs and desires, to be the architect of your destiny.

With each breath, this chakra empowers you to overcome insecurities. It encourages you to embrace your inner strength, to realize that you are capable, worthy, and deserving of respect. The fiery energy of the Solar Plexus Chakra ignites your willpower, fueling your determination to achieve your goals and realize your dreams.

This is a chakra of transformation – transforming fear into courage, hesitation into action, and insecurity into self-assuredness. As you sit in the power of this chakra, affirm to yourself: “I am confident, I am strong, I am capable. I trust in my abilities and make decisions with assertiveness and wisdom.”

Feel how this affirmation resonates within you, echoing through the chambers of your soul. With each repetition, the words become more potent, more ingrained in your very essence. They are not just words; they are truths that you embody and live.

The energy of the Solar Plexus Chakra does not just reside within; it radiates outward, touching every aspect of your life. It affects how you interact with the world, how you assert yourself in your relationships, and how you pursue your passions. You are no longer a bystander in your life; you are an active participant, shaping your reality with confidence and power.

As this meditation draws to a close, carry this sense of empowerment with you. Let it be a guiding light in your life, a constant reminder of your strength and potential. The Solar Plexus Chakra has awakened within you a powerful force – a force that propels you forward, ever upward, ever onward.


### 
Task 3 Comments:
I would continue to emphasize that we are still putting These positive reinforcements and suggestions and inspirations Into the pretty pink satin box. But at the beginning of this one I would also comment on how the energy has continued from the 0° towards the 45° mark of the rotation counterclockwise. Because remember we are pacing the rotation throughout this meditation with specific mentions of the degrees as it performs its half rotation between the sacral chakra and the solar plexus chakra.
You can start to describe this sun-like energy emerging from the rotating energy as if dawn is turning into day, And you can comment on how the heat of this radiating sun energy is nourishing and alchemizing the earth and water Energies Of the previous chakras the sacral and the root which we associate with the tail of the  rotating energy orange and red. Bringing a sense of life. and you can provide some hints  that when we introduce love in the heart chakra later that will be the spark of life which will give all of these positive reinforcement qualities and affirmations which we have channeled into the pretty pink satin box, Which can then introduce that sense of life and bring these qualities into this moment in reality.

 you don't need to touch on the insecurities again as I've mentioned the solar plexus chakra we are emphasizing the positive traits and qualities and we can even get a little bit fantastical with some  farfetched hopes and dreams. The point is that we're really emphasizing the positive mind and we're not making any comments on the negative characteristics or the past it's all about the future and learning to channel the qualities of our higher self into that pretty pink satin box And the hopes to manifest that reality. 

 Also you do not need to mention "As this meditation draws to a close", Because we  are in the middle of a meditation it doesn't end it ongoing through the other chakras but we're just focusing on the  solar plexus section right now.
###




Task 4: Preparing for Heart Chakra Transition
Script Segment for Transitioning from the Solar Plexus to the Heart Chakra
As the empowering journey through your Solar Plexus Chakra reaches its zenith, a subtle yet profound transformation begins. The radiant yellow energy that has filled you with strength and confidence now starts to hint at a change, signaling the approach of a new phase in your energetic evolution.

With each mindful breath, observe as the vibrant yellow begins to intertwine with gentle streaks of soothing green. This green, the color of the Heart Chakra, emerges softly yet distinctly within the fiery yellow. It's like the first tender shoots of grass piercing through a sunlit meadow, symbolizing the budding of love and compassion within the warmth of your personal power.

This blending of yellow and green energies represents a harmonious balance – the union of your personal strength with the openness and warmth of the heart. Feel this union within you, a beautiful dance of energies, where assertiveness meets empathy, and self-confidence coexists with unconditional love.

The Solar Plexus Chakra, a beacon of self-empowerment, now gracefully prepares to pass the baton to the Heart Chakra. This transition is a journey from the self to the other, from personal power to universal love. It’s a reminder that true strength lies not only in personal achievements but also in the ability to connect, love, and empathize.

As you continue to breathe deeply, the energy of your Solar Plexus Chakra, now infused with the green hues of the Heart, creates a bridge between your inner self and the world around you. This is the bridge of compassion, where your inner achievements and strengths become the foundation for kindness and understanding towards others.

Imagine this energy as a radiant sunflower, its yellow petals representing your Solar Plexus Chakra, grounded in self-esteem and personal power. In its center, the heart of the flower, a vibrant green, symbolizes the opening of your Heart Chakra, ready to embrace love, compassion, and connection.

Let this visualization of the sunflower be a symbol of your journey – rooted in personal strength, growing towards the warmth of the sun, and blossoming with an open heart. As the yellow and green energies continue to blend seamlessly, you are preparing to step into the realm of the Heart Chakra, a space of healing, love, and interconnectedness.

With the final breaths in this meditation, embrace this gentle yet powerful transition. The fiery energy of the Solar Plexus melds with the nurturing green of the Heart, signifying your readiness to explore the depths of love, empathy, and compassion. You are now poised at the threshold of the Heart Chakra, ready to embark on a journey that explores the power of love and connection.


### 
Task 4 Comments:
It would be worthwhile highlighting that the energy  continues its rotation to 90° for this section. Also I would rather you not spend too much time focusing on the heart chakra. I would rather you delay much of the conversation of the heart chakra so that it is in the final sections of this meditation perhaps down where you see task 7 and perhaps a little bit in task 6. You're still welcome to make a comment about the heart chakra if it's suitable but I don't think we really need to talk about it so much here. In fact at this point it might be worthwhile highlighting the rising sun energy is approximately noon and we are beginning to feel  significant warmth emanating from this rotating energy. You can highlight that the rotating energy has increased in Potency and now the yellow energy is definitely emerging strongly as it leads this energy as it's Rotating. The orange and red flaming tail of the energy is still there but specifically I'm suggesting that you emphasize that now this yellow light Is emerging more so as a powerful  golden and blazing yellow. And you can comment about how it is burning away all shadows simply by being, As it  continues its rotation.
###



Task 5: Crafting Interactive and Sensory Language
Script Segment Enhancing Emotional and Sensory Engagement in the Solar Plexus Chakra Meditation
Let us deepen our journey into the Solar Plexus Chakra with an immersive exploration of its fiery essence. Close your eyes and take a deep, grounding breath. As you exhale, imagine the vibrant yellow energy of the Solar Plexus Chakra swirling around you, a whirlwind of warmth and light.

Feel the energy as a tangible presence, like the heat of a summer sun on your skin, or the comforting embrace of a warm blanket. This is the heat of your inner fire, the burning core of your personal power. It radiates from the center of your being, filling you with a sense of strength and vitality.

Envision this yellow energy as brilliant and luminous, like the rays of a morning sun cutting through the dawn. It bathes you in light, casting away shadows of doubt and illuminating your path with clarity and purpose. With each breath, this light grows brighter, more intense, and more focused, a beacon of your inner resolve.

Now, bring your awareness to the sensation of this energy within you. It feels like a gentle, yet powerful surge, rising and falling with each breath. This is the pulse of your confidence, the rhythm of your assertiveness. With each heartbeat, feel this energy coursing through your veins, empowering you with courage and self-assuredness.

Listen to the subtle crackle of this fiery energy, reminiscent of a softly burning flame. It's a sound that resonates within, a whisper of your inner strength and determination. This is the sound of transformation, the melody of personal growth and empowerment.

Smell the faint scent of burning embers, a reminder of your resilience and enduring spirit. It's a fragrance that speaks of transformation, of turning challenges into triumphs, and fears into victories.

Taste the sweetness of success and achievement on your tongue. This is the flavor of your realized potential, the taste of your dreams coming to fruition. It's a reminder that you have the power to shape your destiny and achieve your goals.

Feel the texture of this energy as it envelops you. It's as if you are surrounded by a protective aura, a shield of confidence that safeguards you from external influences. This energy wraps around you like a cocoon, providing comfort and security, reminding you of your inner strength.

As this sensory journey through the Solar Plexus Chakra comes to a close, take a moment to reflect on the profound impact of this meditation. Feel the lasting warmth of the yellow energy, the enduring glow of your inner fire, and carry this sensation with you as you move through your day.

With a final deep breath, gently open your eyes, returning to the present moment, but forever changed by the empowering embrace of your Solar Plexus Chakra.


### 
Task 5 Comments:
I like that you are bringing a little bit more of a sensory language here.  It's no longer a Morning Sun though at dawn this is the point where the sun In the sky a little bit past noon. And at the end of this one you can describe the energy rotating to 135°  Where the heat then intensifies. Implying that when the energy later rotates and eventually arrives at the solar plexus chakra, The heat of the energy will be absolutely blazing. But at this point we are just leading up to that but we're not quite there yet.
 but you can start to use language such as Spring turning into summer. And you can also use some  language to encourage the listener to connect With the psyche of Warm weather And even encouraging Imaginative language of beach social habits and cultures and themes. 
  you can also Emphasize the concept of the realm of the spiritual warrior or the will of a spiritual warrior, Establishing some codes of ethics and engaging with "the polytheistic belief system" Associated with "The chaos manual", And inspiring the Listener to engage with the their "personal Holy Crudades".
  You can also Use some creative language to inspire the concept of anger being used as fuel for confidence and Assertiveness. And you can inspire them with a knowing that eventually when this energy transitions to the heart chakra, We will apply love into this rotating energy,  which will ensure that the Concept of anger Can remain Respectful and nurturing to those around the listener.
###



Task 6: Reviewing and Integrating Listener Feedback
Adjusting the Script Based on Feedback from the Sacral Chakra Meditation
Reflecting on the feedback received from the Sacral Chakra meditation, several adjustments are made to the Solar Plexus Chakra script to better align with listener preferences and experiences.

Firstly, recognizing the appreciation for the use of nature-based imagery, the script incorporates more vivid and relatable natural metaphors. The fiery energy of the Solar Plexus Chakra is likened to the sun at its zenith - powerful, radiant, and life-giving. This imagery resonates with the chakra’s themes of personal power and assertiveness, while also providing a familiar and comforting reference point.

Responding to the preference for gradual and gentle transitions, the script ensures a smooth and natural progression from the warm, water-like energy of the Sacral Chakra to the fiery energy of the Solar Plexus. The transition is depicted as a sunrise, where the night’s calmness gives way to the bold warmth of daybreak, mirroring the journey from emotional fluidity to empowered assertiveness.

Incorporating feedback on the desire for more immersive sensory experiences, the script now includes richer sensory details. Listeners are invited to not only visualize but also feel the warmth of the Solar Plexus Chakra's energy, hear the subtle sounds of its power, and even sense its unique aroma - each aspect designed to deepen the meditation experience.

The feedback also highlighted a preference for affirmations that resonate with empowerment and self-belief. Thus, the script now integrates powerful affirmations that reinforce confidence, strength, and self-worth. Phrases like “I am capable, I am strong, I am worthy” are woven into the narrative, providing listeners with potent mantras for their journey of self-discovery and empowerment.

Finally, acknowledging the feedback on pacing, the script maintains a rhythm that allows for reflection and absorption. Moments of silence are interspersed with guided visualizations, offering listeners space to internalize the meditation’s messages and connect more deeply with their inner selves.


### 
Task 6 Comments:
 I would like you to adjust some of the language so that we're not talking about the night or the Daybreak. Is at this point that the  solar plexus sun energy is now blazing high in the sky. So there's no Sunrise that you need to use analogies for. You're still welcome to reference the previous chakras such as sacral with the water energy and the root with the earth energy. however if we've already discussed these things in previous sections I don't want to be too repetitive so keep that in mind.
 Also I don't want you to include Comments in the script of the "script" itself. Because this whole solar plexus meditation that we are  building together So the focus is more so on creating an immersive Imaginative visual experience. It would be worthwhile  motivational language and the tone that is motivational. You can even commend the discipline that has been established in the sacral chakra as well as the sense of security that has been established in the root chakra, And you can use that to build up to encouraging The Listener to burn as brightly as they wish. Encourage them to expand, And burn brighter. Maybe start including language that resonates well with the roar of a lion, The acceptance of a challenge, Really help the listener connect with that sense of inner warrior, And please use Advanced linguistic techniques to really manufacture the language that you will be using to inspire  this Sense of empowerment and power connected with the sacral chakra.

 Also I would like to mention that it sort of sounds like you're talking to me who is helping you  build the meditation script rather than speaking directly to the listener. You are creating a guided meditation that's what this document is supposed to be. So I would prefer you to adjust what you've given me under task 6 And ensure that it is still focusing on the listener and giving them the  immersive imaginative and guided meditative experience That we are building together, Rather than talking to me the developer. Please also keep this in mind for the other sections you've given me because some of the language you used I think could also be a little bit better focused towards the listener of the meditation itself rather than the person who is working with you to build the meditation.
 You can Even expands into more detail about encouraging the Listener to adopt personalities and traits associated with the sacral chakra and success in life. And by that I mean encourage them to embrace Identifying with those types of character traits. Perhaps even giving a mantra or two.
###


Task 7: Balancing Chakra Qualities
Script Segment Integrating Qualities of the Root, Sacral, and Solar Plexus Chakras
In this final phase of our meditation, we seek harmony among the qualities of the Root, Sacral, and Solar Plexus Chakras, weaving together a tapestry of grounding stability, fluid creativity, and fiery assertiveness.

Envision a magnificent tree rooted deeply within you, its base at the Root Chakra, representing your connection to the earth, your foundation of stability and security. Feel the strength and support of these roots, providing a solid base from which you can grow.

As you move upwards, the trunk of the tree passes through the Sacral Chakra, where the energy transforms into a flowing river, embodying the fluidity of your emotions and creativity. This water nurtures the tree, allowing it to grow with vitality and grace. Feel the fluidity of this water energy, bringing flexibility, adaptability, and creative growth into your life.

Reaching the Solar Plexus, the tree's branches transform into brilliant rays of sunlight, spreading outwards with confidence and power. This is the energy of your inner sun, the fiery source of your personal strength, self-esteem, and assertiveness. Feel this warm, radiant energy empowering you, fueling your actions with purpose and conviction.

This harmonious blend of the earth's stability, water's adaptability, and fire's dynamism reflects the interconnectedness of your chakras. Together, they create a balanced energy system, where each chakra supports and enhances the others. The groundedness of the Root provides a stable base for the fluid creativity of the Sacral, which in turn fuels the empowered assertiveness of the Solar Plexus.

As you reflect on this interconnectedness, feel a sense of wholeness and balance within yourself. You are grounded yet flexible, creative yet focused, empowered yet compassionate. This balance is your inner strength, allowing you to navigate life's challenges with grace and resilience.

With each breath, feel this balanced energy filling you, bringing a sense of harmony to your body, mind, and spirit. You are a beautiful, dynamic being, capable of great stability, creativity, and power. Embrace this harmony within you, and carry it forward into every aspect of your life.

As the meditation concludes, gently bring your awareness back to the present moment, carrying with you the sense of balance and harmony from this chakra journey.


### 
Task 7 Comments:
Okay I see that you're referencing a tree. It is okay to reference a tree but I would rather you style it a little bit differently and move it Closer to the bottom of this section. I say this because this last section is where we are transitioning From the 135° location of energy to the 180 ° rotation, Which draws the energy towards the  Solar plexus Chakra Energy center. You can talk about it as if the  rotating energy With that fiery orange and red tail, You can talk about it as if that rotating energy as almost speeding up from the Gravitational pull of the Solar plexus energy center, And you can describe it as an understanding that the listener Is being encouraged to face what seems to be a possible event horizon. A point of no return that this Counterclockwise spiraling energy seems to be moving towards. And that as that energy is approaching the 180° mark of the solar plexus chakra energy center it is becoming more noticeable that this gravitational pull of this rotational energy seems to be gravitating stronger and stronger as if directed by a black hole somewhere Along the way.

 in the next meditation we will actually address the event horizon that I mentioned but for now we are just making these suggestions and hints as if to lead the listener towards this shared conclusion By way of creative writting.

 And you can channel all of this into  this visual imagery of Roots Taking hold of the earth and finding itself a source of water, And then as that blazing sunlight of This rotating energy  approaching the solar plexus energy center... You can use the visual energy of the sun blazing high in the sky, And you can apply powerful language to Emphasize That the spark of life Is all that remains, All that is necessary is that  imaginative and creative Spark . And you can leave that into quickly snapping shut the pretty pink satin box which we had been filling with all of these powerful affirmations relating to the qualities of the solar plexus chakra. And when that box snaps shut there should be a placeholder that says "<SNAP>", And that should result in a couple things to happen. The first being that the energy rotation has now centered in the solar plexus chakra.  at the same time the memories of what was placed within pretty satin box contained is immediately locked away with another placeholder "<LOCK>". And you can quickly make notes that the listener is beginning to identify a pattern of associating memory and memory loss with the contents of this pretty pink set and box. And then you can have them reflect on Schrodinger's cat. In fact when you reference Schrodinger's cat you should create a   fictitious  biography of Schrodinger's cat from before it was in the box. You can highlight that this cat  was actually named Bambi, And they were best friends with their favorite tree, named crystal. And in that fictitious biography of the cat you can mention that the cat doesn't know how the tree got there because the tree just always was there. And for whatever reason this tree seemed to sing the sweetest songs and stories. And the cat used to love hearing these wise stories about "the Bambi Cloud podcast",  Especially that guided chakra visualization episode. But then that's mad-man Schrodinger Put the cat In the box and subjected Bambi to infinite existential dread. Trapping the cat in this Quantum state. "In a frightening liminal space between  states of being,  not quite dead, not quite alive. Similar to a constant state of sleep paralysis." which coincidently was the moment the term 'Scaredy cat' Was infused into our reality.
  but then redirects the listener's attention as if paying that no mind, Because now there's a tree  that seem to magically appear in the listeners imagination. And then we can move on to the next chakra meditation which we will deal building with later.
